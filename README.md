Project realised for the course of High Performance Parallel Computing, held by professor Umberto Villato at University of Sannio for the Academic Year 2024/2025.

This project aims to implement a parallel sudoku solver using MPI and pthreads, and compare its performance to a serial version of the code to evaluate. To make it more testable and accessible, we also included a sudoku generator to create some tables with which test the system. The generator is based on a sudoku solver realised by Dimitris Boutzounis, where he implemented Donald Knuth's Algorithm X as a sudoku solver.
